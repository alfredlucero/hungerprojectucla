			    <p class="medium-8 columns">﻿Founded in 1987, Hunger Project is dedicated to fighting poverty by combining direct service, advocacy, and education. Volunteers deliver food, serve meals, provide job assistance, and teach life skills classes.  Our ultimate goal is to provide services to homeless and low-income individuals in helping meet their immediate and long-term needs. Hunger Project at UCLA has always implemented programs to alleviate some of the problems of homelessness in Los Angeles.  We do this by informing and educating UCLA students and leading by example through volunteering programs.  At the same time we encourage students to become active in the community by offering volunteer programs that are accessible to anyone in the UCLA community.  The two active programs that have persisted throughout the history of Hunger Project at UCLA are the food salvage program and the health clinic program.

In addition the event highlights the work and experiences of community leaders that work with the homeless.

						<h2>HUNGER PROJECT INTERACTS WITH TENANTS AT HOLLYWOOD HOMELESS SHELTER</h2>
						<h3>DAILY BRUIN | APRIL 9, 2015</h3>
						<p>Hunger Project, a community service organization, has shifted its focus from packing lunches to more face-to-face interaction with homeless communities across Los Angeles. One way they do this is by volunteering at temporary homeless shelters such as People Assisting the Homeless (PATH) Hollywood, where they cook and serve dinner to the homeless tenants.</p>

						<p class="medium-8 columns">From his family’s one-bedroom apartment in West Los Angeles, Stiven Pesjaka treks to UCLA alone on Saturday mornings for free SAT tutoring. The high school junior wants a high test score so he can get into the college of his choice and achieve his goal of becoming a mechanical engineer. His end goal is earning enough to financially support his mother, who works long hours as a nanny, and his brother, who is blind.
						<br />
							Students in the Hunger Project at UCLA, an organization represented by the Undergraduate Students Association Council Community Service Commission, aim to prepare students from high schools around Los Angeles every Saturday for the SAT.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							The high school students study test-taking strategies, and, for the first time this quarter, they will learn how to craft personal statements and apply for scholarships. The project has also begun tutoring students from Helen Bernste in High School in Hollywood this quarter, along with students from two other sites.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							At the Ackerman Union patio on Saturday, 14 high school students gathered and took short practice exams, reviewed results from a diagnostic SAT exam they had taken the previous week and paired up with mentors who scheduled personalized study plans with them.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							The tutoring session commenced with a 25-minute practice essay. After students read through the prompt, pensive looks quickly turned into determined gazes, and a flurry of scribbling began.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							The Hunger Project at UCLA, founded in 1987, has historically focused on food service projects.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							However, group members decided to make education a key component of the organization’s focus at the beginning of this school year, said Xuan Dang, a fourth-year molecular, cell and developmental biology student and co-external executive of the project.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							“I really want to promote (education) because I know many kids who are economically disadvantaged, but have the potential to be great leaders and make a positive impact in the community,” Dang said. “But they need to be given the opportunities first.”
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">	
							Nick Vincent, a second-year electrical engineering student and tutor, said that while many students initially came into the program with minimal preparation for the SAT, he thinks they can now tackle more complex questions.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							“By the end of the quarter, students would ask me a question, and other students would chime in and start teaching it themselves,” he said, laughing.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							Thomas Luong, a UCLA alumnus and SAT adviser for the Hunger Project at UCLA, said he thinks students from disadvantaged backgrounds sometimes lack strong college counseling programs and tutoring services, which can deter them from pursuing a college education.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							Luong said he joined the Hunger Project because he knows what it’s like to struggle growing up. “My mom worked in sweatshops around the Los Angeles area,” Luong said. “Before we were in kindergarten, we would help her prepare clothes by gluing labels to the clothing.”
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							Luong said he wants to motivate high school students in the project to be proactive about their education and hopefully give back to their communities one day. “Going to college allowed me to see outside the bubble of poverty,” Luong said. “Now I have a perspective of where I stood, and know what I can do to change things.”
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							Pesjaka is also working toward change so he can provide financial stability for his current family and any children he may have. “If I do have my own family, I want my kids to have the stuff I never had,” he said.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							Bruce Crane, the father of high school sophomore Bruce Daniel Crane, said that after his son started attending tutoring sessions with the Hunger Project, he began studying more diligently.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							While Bruce Daniel Crane attends tutoring for two hours, his father and younger brother wait at Kerckhoff patio and read. The family commutes to UCLA every weekend on the bus, but Bruce Crane said he thinks the time and travel are worth it.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							“I would be extremely proud if he got into college,” Bruce Crane said. “There would be fulfillment in my life as far as my role as a father to see him achieve that.” Eyes beaming, Bruce Daniel Crane said he’s aiming for the highest possible score on the SAT – a 2400.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							For Pesjaka, Crane and other students, the SAT tutoring service that the Hunger Project at UCLA offers is one of the few free test prep options out there that they know of.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							Some of the high school students said they would have to pay at least a hundred dollars for other programs if they could not receive free tutoring from the project.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							Dang said she thinks that while some parents have the resources to help improve their children’s SAT scores, those from low-income backgrounds do not always have the same options. “Even if students want to pursue higher education, (the SAT) could be the door that shuts them out,” Dang said.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							At the end of Saturday’s tutoring session, after the noisy bustle of the students subsided, Pesjaka said he feels he has improved on some sections of the test.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							“I’ve never stopped trying, and I’m not going to stop now,” he said.

							Annie Nguyen volunteered with the UCLA Hunger Project every week last year. She helped cook and serve food to the homeless, then ate dinner and got to know the residents of the shelter. “I really enjoy going there every week,” the third-year psychology and Spanish student said. “I really enjoy hearing their stories because everyone has a different story about how they became homeless.”
							<br />
							<br />
							She was surprised by some of the accounts she heard.
							<br />
							<br />
							“They’re really motivated,” she said. “A lot of them have college degrees. You can learn a lot from them.”
							<br />
							<br />
							Nguyen and other members of the Hunger Project draw from this experience volunteering for People Assisting the Homeless ““ an organization that shelters the homeless while they search for jobs ““ when they work on UCLA’s own food drive to benefit both the UCLA Food Closet and the Los Angeles Regional Foodbank.

						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							The food drive is a collaborative effort between many campus organizations, including the Hunger Project, UCLA Transportation and the Volunteer Center, said Antoinette Mongelli, the center’s executive director.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							Last year, UCLA Transportation collected 42,000 pounds of food and between $6,000 and $7,000 in donations.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							The Hunger Project got involved with this year’s drive when the Volunteer Center contacted the student group and asked if it wanted to be involved with the transportation department’s food drive.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">	
							Mongelli also said the center wanted to make sure the Food Closet, a service providing needy students with food, would be a beneficiary of the food drive.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							“What makes this year’s project unique is that 50 percent of the proceeds are going to the UCLA Food Closet, not just the L.A. Foodbank,” Mongelli said.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							The other portion will go to the food bank to benefit the greater L.A. community, including needy staff members, Mongelli added.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							Food drive organizers welcome donations of basic food items, as well as those necessary for a traditional holiday meal. As an alternative to donating canned and boxed foods, students can make monetary donations online, said Penny Menton, the associate director of UCLA Transportation. “A lot of students can’t go buy cans of food, but they can donate $1, $2 or $10,” she said. Menton said there is an increased need to help the needy this year.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							“I think there’s a renewed interest in volunteerism and community service, especially in these hard economic times,” Menton said. “It reminds us of how fortunate we are and gives us the opportunity to give back.”
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							The food drive will continue until Dec. 16 and will collect food and donations from more than 50 campus departments, student groups and other campus entities.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">
							Any group interested in obtaining a donation box is welcome to participate, Menton said.
						</p>
						<p class="medium-12 columns">

						<h2>TRADER JOE’S, COFFEEHOUSE, DELI OPEN THIS MONTH</h2>
						<h3>DAILY BRUIN | NOVEMBER 30, 2008</h3>
						<p>Glendon Avenue will soon be the home of several new businesses, most of which are set to open this week. With the addition of a new eatery, a specialty-food store and a coffeehouse, owners hope to attract the patronage of UCLA students before they depart for winter break.</p>
						<p>
							Located at 1000 Glendon Ave., the specialty-food store, Trader Joe’s, will open on Dec. 5, according to Daily Bruin archives. Advertised as a neighborhood grocery store, this business is known for its healthy and unique products, all of which lack artificial colors, preservatives and flavors, as well as MSG and trans fats, according to the chain’s Web site.
						</p>
						<p>
							Close to Trader Joe’s is the chain coffee shop, It’s a Grind, which opened on Sunday. With student-friendly amenities such as free Internet access, plenty of seating, and extended hours during finals week, this coffeehouse aims to attract students, according to Daily Bruin archives.
						</p>
						<p>
							Right next door to the coffee shop is Jersey Mike’s, a 52-year-old sandwich chain that was originally founded in New Jersey, according to Daily Bruin archives. “We provide the highest quality products,” said Marvin Barsky, owner of the Westwood branch. He added that the chain was known for cooking all of its food on the premises and carving, slicing and making the sandwich in front of the customer.
						</p>
						<p>
							Despite the projected opening date of Dec. 3, the eatery was forced to postpone its grand opening until the middle of December due to delays in city approval.
						</p>
						<p>
							“We’re finished building and we’re ready to go, but we’re just waiting for the city inspectors and the fire department,” Barsky said.
						</p>
						<p>
							As part of the store’s commitment to community involvement, Jersey Mike’s has agreed to fundraise on behalf of the UCLA student group, Hunger Project, a 21-year-old organization that focuses on feeding those homeless in Los Angeles.
						</p>
						<p>
							After reading about the organization online, Barsky contacted Hunger Project executive directors Jessica Hoang and Jessica Chu through e-mail to see if they would be interested in a joint fundraiser.
						</p>
						<p>
							“I was looking for something that the school would be interested in,” Barsky said. “I felt that this was a group of people who really cared.”
						</p>
						<p>
							With a $1 donation, patrons of the store can receive a free sandwich. A total of 10,000 sandwiches will be given out, to raise a total of $10,000, according to Daily Bruin archives.
						</p>
						<p>
							Proceeds from the fundraiser will go towards Hunger Banquet, an awareness event hosted by Hunger Project during winter quarter.
						</p>
						<p>
							During this free event, participants experience the relationship between economic prosperity and the prevalence of food, said Hoang, a fourth-year biology student.
						</p>
						<p>
							After receiving a new identity for the evening, participants are served food according to the social class that they were given. Those who are part of the “lower class” receive basic staples, such as beans, while the “upper-class” participants are able to indulge in a multiple course meal.
						</p>
						<p>
							“It’s a good way to experience social class,” Hoang said.
