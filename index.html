			    <p class="medium-8 columns">﻿Founded in 1987, Hunger Project is dedicated to fighting poverty by combining direct service, advocacy, and education. Volunteers deliver food, serve meals, provide job assistance, and teach life skills classes.  Our ultimate goal is to provide services to homeless and low-income individuals in helping meet their immediate and long-term needs. Hunger Project at UCLA has always implemented programs to alleviate some of the problems of homelessness in Los Angeles.  We do this by informing and educating UCLA students and leading by example through volunteering programs.  At the same time we encourage students to become active in the community by offering volunteer programs that are accessible to anyone in the UCLA community.  The two active programs that have persisted throughout the history of Hunger Project at UCLA are the food salvage program and the health clinic program.

										We provide support to the residents by cooking delicious and nutritious food for them. Nutrition is a big focus for this program, as it can be difficult to get a balanced diet when funds are limited. Following the food preparation and serving, we also share a meal with the residents to get to know them on a personal level.

				        	<h3>INVOLVEMENT:</h3>
				        	<p>
										Hunger Project plays a large role in providing volunteers and leading discussions for events throughout the week. While tabling for the event, UCLA students are encouraged to come to the Hunger Project table and help prepare hygiene kits and snack packages that we will distribute to recipients on Skid Row. Hunger Banquet is also hosted during this week.

				        		 Taking place during Homeless Awareness Week, Hunger Banquet is another way for us to show UCLA students what homelessness in the LA community is like. As part of this program, students are randomly given ‘socioeconomic standings’ that dictate what kinds of foods they will have access to, to show the kinds of limitations that poverty places upon those who undergo it. In addition the event highlights the work and experiences of community leaders that work with the homeless.
